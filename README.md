# SinceAraboxcis

University of York MSc Bioinformatics students worked together to create individual gene regulatory networks for Arabidopsis thaliana at distinct stages of development, using scRNA-Seq data (Lee et al. 2023). The networks specifically illuminate the relationships between G-Box-associated-genes (genes with G-Boxes in their promotor regions) and bHLH/bZIP family transcription factors which bind to G-Boxes. 

All analysis is performed using RStudio. Normalization and clustering is performed using Seurat, network inference is performed using GENIE3, networks are visualized using Gephi. 

I will now use this data to create a web resource for researchers to use to guide their experiments. This will be done using Shiny.
